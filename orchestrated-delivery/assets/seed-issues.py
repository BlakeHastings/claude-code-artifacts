"""Seed a GitHub issue graph: epics, leaf issues, and real sub-issue links.

Run once. Resumable: every created number is recorded in STATE_FILE, so a rerun
after a failure links what exists rather than duplicating half the backlog.

Epics and issues reference each other by KEY, not by number, because numbers do
not exist at authoring time.

    python seed-issues.py --dry-run     # print what would be created
    python seed-issues.py               # create it

Keep this file in the repo afterwards. It documents the original shape of the
work and is the fastest way to seed the next project.

### Definition of done
Per `docs/process/review.md`. Mechanical checks (typecheck, lint, tests, build,
migrations) are CI's job. This issue is done when a reviewer has:

- **Functionality** driven the running app and confirmed the happy path plus one
  realistic failure path, with no console errors and no new error-level logs.
- **Code** explained what the change does in their own words without asking the
  author.
- **Architecture** accounted for new patterns, dependencies and duplication. Any
  new pattern gets a short ADR in `docs/architecture/decisions/`.
