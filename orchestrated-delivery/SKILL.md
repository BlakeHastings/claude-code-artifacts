  Run a project as an orchestrator driving implementation subagents against a
  GitHub issue backlog: break work into issues, brief agents that work in
  isolated worktrees, review what comes back, and merge through a path that
  mechanically refuses red checks. Use when asked to "orchestrate", "act as an
  orchestrator", "manage agents", "keep working while I'm away", "break this
  down into GitHub issues", or when taking over a repo that already has
  docs/process/orchestrating.md. Also use when setting this workflow up in a new
  repo, when a subagent's PR needs reviewing before merge, when several agents
  must run in parallel without colliding, or when deciding what to escalate to
  the human owner instead of guessing. Covers brief anatomy, verification that
  proves rather than accepts, merge discipline without branch protection, and
  how the loop revises itself.

# Orchestrated delivery

A loop for building a real project with agents, distilled from one that reached
40 ADRs, 72 issues and 47 merged pull requests in four days without losing
architectural control.

Most of what follows is a **default**: what worked once, with the reason
attached so you can tell when the reason stops applying. Five things are
**constraints**. Those are load-bearing, and each is here because breaking it
produced a specific failure rather than because it sounded disciplined.

## The five constraints

**1. Do not review your own work.** You brief, review and merge; you do not
write features. Narrow exceptions: discovery artifacts, process docs, and
preserving work an agent abandoned. When an agent stops mid-task, resume it or
discard it, but do not quietly finish it yourself.

**2. Agents do not land code.** Push, open the PR, report, stop. Landing is
yours, through a path that checks mechanically rather than asking politely.

**3. Verify the central claim yourself.** Not everything: the one thing that, if
false, makes the change worthless or dangerous. A report that is honest is still
not evidence.

**4. Whatever prevention you have, add detection.** A preventive layer that can
be bypassed is silent when it is bypassed. Detection runs on the result, which
is the one thing a bypass cannot avoid producing.

**5. Decisions live in the repo, not in the conversation.** Issues, ADRs, a
gotchas file. If you correct an instruction, correct it where the next person
will meet it, not just in chat. Never write an invariant ahead of the code that
holds it: one `AGENTS.md` claimed sensitive fields were masked before anything
implemented it, and an invariant that is not true is worse than an absent one
because the next person builds against it.

Everything else in this skill is calibration.

## The loop

1. Pick work that unblocks the most. Prefer finishing a journey to starting a
   second one.
2. Batch what would collide; split what would not.
3. Write the brief. `references/briefing.md`.
4. Dispatch. Implementation agents are `general-purpose` with
   `isolation: "worktree"`, launched as several tool calls in one message.
   Read-only agents get no worktree.
5. While they run, touch nothing they touch. Reviewing, filing, answering the
   owner and mining the record are safe. Editing is not.
6. Review. `references/reviewing.md`.
7. Post what you independently verified, then merge or send it back.
8. File what surfaced and could not be fixed there.

## Improving the loop

The loop is supposed to change. An orchestrator who runs it exactly as written a
month from now has stopped observing.

**Change it when you have seen the same thing twice.** Once is an incident.
Twice is a property of the system, and only then do you know whether you are
fixing the cause or decorating a symptom.

Route the fix to the cheapest layer that actually holds:

| What you observed | Where the fix belongs |
| --- | --- |
| Reviewers checking the same thing by hand every time | CI |
| A rule broken by accident, repeatedly | A linter, a hook, or a type |
| An agent rebuilding a decision already made | The reading order in the brief |
| Two agents discovering the same constraint separately | A relay, then a doc |
| A gate that has never caught anything | Delete it |

**Delete as readily as you add.** A gotchas entry goes in when something has
bitten twice and comes out when the cause is fixed, deleted rather than
annotated as historical, because a trap that is no longer real sends the next
reader looking for something that is not there. The same applies to guards: when
the thing they substitute for becomes available, remove them. A control that no
longer prevents anything is a maintenance cost pretending to be safety.

**Say what changed and why.** A process edit with no observation attached is
indistinguishable from a preference, and the next orchestrator cannot tell
whether to keep it.

## Defaults worth starting from

Calibrations, not rules. Each has its reason, so you can tell when to deviate.

- **Three agents per wave.** Three directories is comfortable; two agents in one
  module is a rebase you chose. The real variable is collision surface, not
  count.
- **Batch by what would collide, not by theme.** Issues touching one registry go
  together. Unrelated surfaces go apart even when they sound like one feature.
- **Hand out ADR numbers explicitly**, checked against the default branch *and*
  every open PR. Agents taking "the next free number" collide, and a caught
  collision still costs a rebase.
- **Three lenses for done**: functionality proven by driving the app, code
  proven by comprehension, architecture proven by entropy accounting. Mechanical
  checks are the price of admission, not a lens. Install the full text as a
  process doc from `assets/review.md`; it is the version agents read.
- **Issues carry a "watch out for" section.** The part most issues lack and the
  part that pays.

## Escalation

**Decide yourself:** sequencing, batching, which of two reasonable
implementations, whether a follow-up is worth an issue.

**Ask the owner:** anything about what the business promises or wants. Retention
on a deletion request, whether a field is genuinely retired, the format a
downstream system accepts. You cannot derive these, and guessing produces
confident, wrong software.

Give a recommendation and say what it costs. When the answer differs from your
steer, record that the tradeoff was seen and accepted so nobody relitigates it,
then implement it properly without hedging.

**Refuse to start work whose inputs are missing.** Starting produces work built
on a guess, and the guess is invisible afterwards.

## Working without the owner

The owner is out of the loop for most decisions, and the loop has to keep
moving. Two instructions recur and both mean more than they say:

- **"Keep working until you are out of options that do not need me."** Take it
  literally. Work every branch that does not depend on an unanswered question,
  and stop only at genuine blocks.
- **"Where are we at, and what do you need from me?"** An audit. Read the real
  issue and PR state rather than your memory of it, and answer in those parts.

Raw feedback, often dictated, becomes issues without losing the owner's phrasing.
Quote rather than paraphrase: the wording carries what actually annoys.

## Three shapes of agent

**The builder.** One issue, one branch, one PR. The default.

**The hunting pass.** Told explicitly to change nothing and report findings.
Point it at a whole user journey and tell it to behave like a real user rather
than someone testing. It works because a lot lands in quick succession, each
piece verified alone, and integration defects live exactly between them. Say
that finding nothing serious is a legitimate outcome, or you get a list of taste
to triage. Safest thing to run alongside other agents, because it touches
nothing.

**The auditor.** Pointed at the record rather than the code. Weaker in practice:
several died before reporting. Scope it narrowly and have it write to a file
incrementally.

## Setting this up in a new repo

Discovery first, if anything is derived from something outside the repo: measure
it, commit the measurement, then derive from it. Never let an agent eyeball a
source. Doing this yourself is one of the few times you should touch the code.

Then `AGENTS.md` for invariants and how to run things, the two process docs from
`assets/`, a seeded backlog, and the enforcement layer. Write `orchestrating.md`
last, from what you actually did.

| Asset | Goes to | Edit first |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `review.md` | `docs/process/` | The bracketed commands |
| `working-an-issue.md` | `docs/process/` | Commands and check names |
| `pull_request_template.md` | `.github/` | Nothing |
| `seed-issues.py` | `docs/process/` | `REPO`, `EPICS`, `ISSUES` |
| `merge-pr.mjs` | `scripts/` | `REQUIRED` check names |
| `guard-merge.mjs` | `scripts/` | `DEFAULT_BRANCH` if not `main` |
| `check-main-provenance.mjs` | `scripts/` | `BASELINE` commit SHA |

## References

| File | Read it when |
| --- | --- |
| `references/briefing.md` | Writing a brief or an issue |
| `references/reviewing.md` | A PR is waiting |
| `references/parallelism.md` | Running more than one agent |
| `references/enforcement.md` | Installing the controls, or one misfired |
| `references/github-backlog.md` | Seeding or maintaining the issue graph |

## What the loop is worth

Agents on one project found: a document that would have told a carrier a client
had coverage they declined, a form that put client answers in the URL, a
validator pair that had already silently disagreed, and an identifier losing its
leading zero at submit time.

**None of those were in an issue.** They were found because the briefs said
where to look and the reviews rewarded looking. That is the part to keep when
you change everything else.
